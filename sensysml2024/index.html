      <p><strong>The 3rd Workshop on Machine Learning on Edge in Sensor Systems (SenSys-ML 2024)</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sensors have become more ubiquitous through the spread of the Internet of Things and increased market
        penetration of smartphones. The ensuing flood of data has the promise to advance state of the art in ways that could
        change the life of every human on the planet, including improvements in healthcare, environmental management,
        and city management. To enable this revolution machine learning needs to fill the gap to turn raw data into an
        understandable and actionable system. However, resource constraints, complex architectures, and challenging study
        designs and ground truth collection are some of the many hurdles that must be overcome to bring a promising idea
        to reality in this domain.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sensys-ML focuses on providing extensive feedback from a diverse pool of people on
        Work In Progress papers involving machine learning on sensor systems (TinyML). The focus is on work that
        combines sensor signals from the physical world with machine learning, particularly in ways that are distributed to
        the device or use edge and fog computing. The development and deployment of ML at the very edge remains a
        technological challenge constrained by computing, memory, energy, network bandwidth and data privacy and
        security limitations. This is especially true for battery operated devices and always-on use cases and applications.
        Our end goal is to help all attendees design systems that are more scientifically advanced, robust to failure,
        efficient, and well validated.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h3 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. There are two submission tracks: 
        <ul>
          <li>Full papers, which will be eligible for publication at most <strong>6 single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages</strong> with 9-pt font size in two-column format, including figures and tables and references. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">here</a>. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 9-pt font, make sure to use \documentclass[9pt, sigconf]{acmart} in your document. This format will be used also for the camera-ready version of accepted papers. Papers will go through double-blind peer reviewing by the PC. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the <a href="https://sensysml2024.hotcrp.com/">Sensys-ML HoTCRP submission site.</a> Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. At least one of the authors of every accepted paper must register and present the paper at the workshop. The program committee will elect one paper for the Best Paper Award.</li>
          <li>Work In Progress, which is a presentation-only format. We request a <strong>1 single spaced 8.5” x 11” page</strong> abstract submission. Please note that these submissions will not be published as this is a presentation-only format.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
